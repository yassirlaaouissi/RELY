# RELY

RELY (Name composed on project members Romy, Esther, Lucille and Yassir) is a python tool developed to help a Digital Forensics Triage procedure on some Microsoft Windows devices.

If you have a percentile of sanity left, you dont use this tool in a professional environment. But if you are crazy enough to use this sovjectbuild, then buckle up. Because you are up for one hell of a ride. Start this tool by running `OneTimeScan.py`, and start hating your life already because we did not include a `requirements.txt`. 

This tool is able to run as a standalone exe, but you are reading this like I remember how the f\*ck we managed to get that working, good luck!
