# RELY

RELY (Name composed on project members Romy, Esther, Lucille and Yassir) is a python tool developed to help a Digital Forensics Triage procedure on some Microsoft Windows devices.

If you have a percentile of sanity left, you dont use this tool in a professional environment. But if you are crazy enough to use this sovjectbuild, then buckle up. Because you are up for one hell of a ride.
